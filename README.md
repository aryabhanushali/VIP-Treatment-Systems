# VIP-Treatment-Systems
Project with AI algorithms learning from past patient information to increase accuracy in insulin dosage reccomendation.
The Insulin Model was created using Jupyter Notebooks with Python

Libraries that Should Be Used: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib [Might need to download Seaborn but might not be necessary (will verify later if we need it)] Also might need to install conda if you do not have python installed on your computer to get access to libraries

Code Breakdown: Data Cleaning: Utilize Pandas to remove data entries that are not relevant to the data analysis and training stages of the model with the database (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

Code Resources:

Linear Regression Model (1 Independent Variable): https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Machine-Learning-Projects-In-Python/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Salary%20Prediction/ML_Linear-Regression.ipynb
Multiple Linear Regression Model 1: https://github.com/tanvi1911/Multiple_Regression_Analysis_on_Diabetes_Dataset
Multiple Linear Regression Model 2: https://github.com/sdrangan/introml/blob/master/unit03_mult_lin_reg/demo1_glucose.ipynb [I think his is the tmost applicable source for completing the project]
Important Factors to Consider as Independent Variables: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age (Verify if this is accurate)

Dependent Variable (Output): Insulin

Machine Learning Implementation: Utilize Numpy and Scikit-Learn to create a linear regression model that

If There is a Need to Create Analytical Plots, then we will use Matplotlib

To-Do: [X] - Complete the Data Cleaning Process by removing irrelevant columns from the dataset [X] - Add Data to Set Up Model for Training [X] - Complete the Pre-Processing Step for Training Model [X] - Complete the Regression Model [X] - Add Model Visuals and Complete Data Analysis
